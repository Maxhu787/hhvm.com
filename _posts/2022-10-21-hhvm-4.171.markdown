HHVM 4.153.3, 4.167.1, 4.168.1, 4.169.1, 4.170.1 and 4.171.0 are released!
4.167.1 is the last release in 4.167 branch, while 4.168 - 4.170 remain
supported, as does the 4.153 LTS release.

Note that HHVM 4.153.2 is also released accidentally, but it does not include
any meaningful change since 4.153.1.

These releases fixes an issue introduced in 4.153.0
([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/291397f88cbe9154e2b228248a2534fbc31ea3f1)).
When combining with [another
commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/280e6899b442796a197b5b236d3ddd50d0b62b5f)
introduced in 4.168.0, it leads to a segmentation fault when building a bytecode
repository for repo-authoritative mode in gcc built HHVM. Earlier releases are
not affected.

# Highlights

- HHVM 4.171.0 includes the fix for repo mode, which is also back-ported to all
  supported HHVM versions
  ([issue](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/9236),
  [commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/1174b9f2e5935ff468b236aba9df0f3d3ff12d5a)).
  The fix makes it possible to migrate the command line flag for building a
  bytecode repository to `--inputs` from `--ffile`, which was dropped in [HHVM
  4.167](https://hhvm.com/blog/2022/08/24/hhvm-4.167.html).
- The following features are now considered preview features with an ongoing
  release, i.e. allowed by the runtime, but not the typechecker:
  - Diamond traits
  ([docs](https://github.com/hhvm/user-documentation/pull/1297),
  [commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/dcfea5ce9ad2658605668cbccbb8e2865a497627))
  - Modules
    ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/cb398e7bb06eeb36e5d54f7fca867cbe30530104))
- Added `ReflectionClass::getModule()` ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/90534fe0eac73122f8867796bbaff45312a4cac8)).
- Added `ReflectionModule::getDocComment()` ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/ef6a56308366ec41e768b35e712c5fc646215123)).
- Added `HH\classname_from_string_unsafe` to convert a string into a lazy class ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/bc7260465933d884cb126dbd2bb5e31609465c37)).
- `HH\embed_type_decl` now supports repo mode ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/1368add9e126642cbb4bf55fb46cab7bf0005e3d)).

# Breaking Changes

- The thrift extension now requires `clearTerseFields` functions in generated
  code
  ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/81b528e7371e8e8da3b61cda2a39844a8129c1c3)).
  Regenerating Hack files from the thrift definition with the [latest thrift
  compiler](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/releases/tag/v2022.10.17.00)
  would provide the required `clearTerseFields` functions.
- The following `hh_server` flags are renamed:
  - `--enable-global-write-check-functions` is renamed to
  `--enable-global-access-check-functions` ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/6730973faed03c5b4e3c48c494704ccaaf722425));
  - `--enable-global-write-check` is
  renamed to `--enable-global-access-check-files` ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/a55be3b322c9b78d3a87e5e9a28ef21905ca1ad4)).
